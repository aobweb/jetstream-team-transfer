## Installation

To get started, run the following commands:

```sh
composer require joelbutcher/jetstream-team-transfer

php artisan jetstream-team-transfer:install
```

The install command will publish a new `Team` model utilising the `TransfersTeam` trait and a `team-transfer-form.blade.php` stub to the `resources/views/teams` directory. It will also replace the default `TeamPolicy` shipped with Jetstream, with a modified version that includes a `transferTeam` method.

> Note: This package only works with the Livewire Jetstream stack.

To include the form in your teams view, add the following livewire component to the `teams/show.blade.php` file:

```php
@livewire('teams.team-transfer-form', ['team' => $team])
```
